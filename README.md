# Image-Classification-between-Nike-and-Adidas-Shoes-using-PIL-and-tflearn

This python script deals woth creating and working with an image classifier between Nike and Adidas Shoes. It has been
made using PIL i.e. Python imaging library instead of openCV and also using the Tensorflow deep learning library, i.e. tflearn.

The Dataset just comprises of about 150 images of the shoes, due to which I was only able to achieve an accuracy of 86%.

The python 3 script has been implemented in Jupyter Notebook that can installed using: pip install jupyter notebook.
